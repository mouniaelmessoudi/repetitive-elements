# Repetitive-Elements

this project aims at data cleaning the TEpipeline output to get more uniform results 

## Project Structure
 
- task1: Visual representations (BarPlot, Stacked BarPlot and Piecharts) using R software, aiming at comparing repetitive elements families in both *Xenopus Tropicalis* and *Xenopus Mellotropicalis*.

- task2: Generating .csv file from an EMBL file format containing repetitive sequences of *Xenopus Tropicalis*, each element with its description (Family clade, Category, Autonomy, Relative age, etc).

- task3: .csv file counting the occurence of the different repetitive element in both *Xenopus Tropicalis* and *Xenopus Mellotropicalis*, a visual representation using R will be added shortly.
